#### This repository houses the information for a linear programming solution.

## Executive Summary
####	Linear programming was applied to determine the optimal diet plan for one week based on five foods (potatoes, greek yogurt, chicken thigh, Polish sausage, eggs) while meeting nutritional need guidelines (for sodium, energy, protein, Vitamin D, calcium, iron, potassium) and minimizing the cost (in dollars). 
The first optimal solution determined the diet plan with the most minimal cost ($94.45) consisted of 0 servings of potatoes, 28.82 servings of greek yogurt, 0 servings of chicken thigh, 44.57 servings of Polish sausage, and 140 servings of eggs. Then, the analysis was rerun to produce at least one serving of each food. This determined an optimal plan with an associated cost of $95.09 and consisted of 1 serving of potatoes, 28.82 servings of greek yogurt, 1 serving of chicken thigh, 42.73 servings of Polish sausage, and 140 servings of eggs. Finally, ChatGPT was utilized to refine the code where the Vitamin D constraint was removed due to only one selected food containing Vitamin D (eggs). This analysis produced an optimal plan with an associated cost of $88.11 and consisted of 39.50 servings of potatoes, 35.87 servings of greek yogurt, 1 serving of chicken thigh, 1 serving of Polish sausage, and 100.06 servings of eggs.
